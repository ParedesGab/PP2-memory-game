## Features 

### Game Header

![Game Header up to Tablets](documentation/website-screenshots/game-name.png)

+ It contains two titles (h1 and h2) positioned at the center of the page, and they are the first elements found across all pages.
    + Clear and easy to read.
    + It uses a futuristic Google font "Rajdhanithat" and a background style that conveys and embraces the cosmic-theme.
  
+ Therefore, the user understands directly that theme of the memory game is related to galaxy, space, universe.

+ The header position and font-size are responsive across all devices. For example, it increases in size in larger screens (**Figure below**). However, it is made smaller in the page where the memory card deck is displayed. 

![Game Header Laptops and up](documentation/website-screenshots/game-name-laptops-up.png)
       
---
### Home Menu Page

![Home menu main page](documentation/website-screenshots/home-menu-main-page.png)

+ The main page of the Galaxy Memory Game, consists of the game heading and the home menu buttons. 

+ The intention was to have a simple yet impactful background that would immediately introduce the galactic theme of the Memory Game.

+ Importantly, the same background is used across all pages. 

+ In addition, the fun universe background allows the title and buttons to stand out.

**Home Menu Buttons**

![Home menu buttons](documentation/website-screenshots/home-menu-buttons.png)

+ The home menu buttons are present on the main page of Memory Game, and they consist on two buttons: Play Game, and Play instructions. 
  
+ They are responsive, and across all devices the home menu buttons are found positioned on top of the other (flex-direction: column) (**Figure below**). 

+ The buttons will rotate slightly and change colors when hovered, creating a smooth, visually appealing interactive effect.

+ Clear and easy to read.
+ Consistent styling and easy navigation.

### Game Indications Page

- This section explains the user how to play and the features to expect. It also introduces the card images whose pairs need to be found. 

- This section is responsive and the images use the flex-wrap property. Top image and bottom images: mobiles and tablets (and larger devices), respectively:

![Game indications mobiles](documentation/website-screenshots/game-indications-mobile.png)

![Game indications tablets and up](documentation/website-screenshots/game-indications-tablets-up.png)

---
### Memory Board Game Page

![Memory board game card deck open](documentation/website-screenshots/memory-game-open.png)

It contains two subsections, from top to bottom:

- With javascript, the class smaller-name was added to the header (i.e., game name), to make the whole page more visually organized. 

**Subsection: Game Board**

- This section presents the memory game itself: a relaxing and fun memory-matching game designed with a space-related theme.

- Players are challenged to match 8 pairs of cards, with a total of 16 cards in the game.

- The card deck array is created by Javascript within the Game Board section. 

 - The game offers a no-pressure environment where players never lose, ensuring a calm and enjoyable experience.

 - The cards will be shuffled and placed face down (**Figure below**), and they have the same hover effect as the home menu buttons. 

![Memory board game card deck closed](documentation/website-screenshots/memory-game-closed.png)
 
 - The memory board game page also contains a "Control Area" section displaying "Moves", "Score" and one button, the "Restart Game", placed on top of the other. 

 - The Restart Game button has the same hover effects as the home menu buttons, and to encourage the user to restart the game as much as they want, the button was made to stand out in orange. 

 - At the beginning of the game:
    - The **Moves** are set to 0, and every time the user chooses two cards, the "moves" will increase by 1.
    - The **Score** is set to 0, and every time there is a match, the player earns 100 points. When the user reaches 800 (i.e., all pairs are matched), the score will show ðŸŽ‰ 800! ðŸŽ‰.

- The MEMORY BOARD GAME section is responsive. Namely:

  -   The card grid maintains 4 columns and 4 rows across all devices, with the width of the cards increasing on larger screens.

  - In tablets and larger screens, the memory card deck and control are placed next to each other (flex-direction: row, by default)

  - In mobiles: the Control Area is placed below the memory card deck. This was achieved because their container (id memory-game-container) was set to display property: flex, and flex-direction: column 

![memory board game mobiles](documentation/website-screenshots/memory-game-mobiles.png)

### Game Finished - Congratulations Page

![congratulations page](documentation/website-screenshots/congratulations-message.png)

- After 4s that user has matched all cards (score: ðŸŽ‰ 800! ðŸŽ‰), the user is redirected to this page that congratulates them for their victory. 

- In addition, the congratulations message displays in bold the amount of moves the user made.

- This section contains two buttons:
  - Home Menu: Directs you back to to the Home Menu page.
  - Play again!: Starts a new game. 

- The buttons use the same style as the home menu buttons. 

- With javascript, the class smaller-name was added to the header (i.e., game name), to make the whole page more visually organized. 

---
## Features left to implement

- Implement a more dynamic galaxy-themed background (e.g., moving nebulas).

- Add a space-themed sound effect by implementing an event listener in JavaScript that triggers whenever a match occurs.

- Add animations for card flips and matches to enhance the user experience.

- Implement visual feedback (e.g., a highlight) for matched pairs.
- Allow users to navigate back to the home page directly from the memory game. Please note that for now this option was intentionally excluded to encourage players to stay on the game page longer, with the added flexibility to restart the game if they wish.

- I intentionally left out a timer to keep the game relaxed and pressure-free. However, if feedback suggests it, Iâ€™d be happy to implement it with JavaScript.

- Due to time constraints, I used onclick in all buttons of the HTML document for faster implementation. However, I recognize that mixing structure (HTML) with functionality (JS) is not best practice, as it can make the code harder to maintain and does not facilitate collaboration in team environments. After the project is graded, I plan to refactor the code by removing inline onclick attributes, and instead handling events via JavaScript by adding event listeners, ensuring better separation of concerns and improving maintainability.

## Design

### Color scheme

![Color scheme](documentation/design/color-scheme.png)

- The russian violet (blue), seasalt (white) and davy's gray color where used as the main colors of the website. Their choice was inspired by the universe background image and their used keeps the website cohesive.

- The russian violet (blue) was used for the titles, button names and the paragraph within the Game indications section.

- All buttons except for the button with class btn--restart, used as box shadow the color davy's gray color. 

- To simulate colors of the universe the hover effect used two colors as gradient: Royal purple ( #7943af) and Sapphire ( #3455af). 

- The button with the class btn--restart and the congratulatory message are styled in Sinopia orange to ensure that they stand out. This vibrant choice draws attention to the restart option, making it easy for users to replay the game, and highlights the victory message effectively, celebrating the user's success in a visually striking way.

### Typography

- "Rajdhani" and "Roboto" from Google Fonts were used as the primary and secondary font of the website, respectively. 
- The generic family name is "Sans-serif".
- For the titles (h1 and h2) letter-spacing CSS property with a value of 0.3rem was used, to add a slight space between letters in the text.

## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
  1. The nav element was initially written as "navigation". 
        - Solution: this mistake was spotted and corrected. 

  2. The flex:1 0 auto was used to not shrink the main content, and push the footer down. However, this did not work.
        - Solution: A Devtools warning message showed that the CSS body selector had the declaration written incorrectly. Namely it was as flex:display instead of display:flex. This was corrected accordingly.

  3. At some point when testing responsiveness, the header width was larger than the main section width. As a result, the use of the responsive dimensions of devtools was not possible. 
        - Solution: A red background color was used to check where the error might be coming from, and it was due to the size of one picture. Given that the header had a CSS width property of 100%, it was a adjusting to the width of this picture. This was resolved by resizing the picture. 

  4. WAVE showed the below error in the navigation bar. 
        - Solution: The error was googled and it happened because wave is likely not recognizing the i tag of the Font Awesome link. This was solved by adding a span element.
      ![bug WAVE](documentation/bugs/bug-wave.png)

  5. HTML validator showed that the meta keywords were missing for the newsletter page. 
        - Solution: This was added accordingly. 

  6. In the successful page, the "Return to home page" was initially a button element placed as descendant of an anchor element. HTML validator showed this error. 
        - Solution: This was corrected by removing the button element, and using only the anchor element. 
    ![bug WAVE](documentation/bugs/bug-successful-page.png)

+ ### Unfixed bugs

  -  The successful.html file has a different indentation than the other html files. Namely, 1 tab is 8 spaces instead of 4. This "error" was googled, consulted with the mentor, and the indent-rainbow extension was installed but this issue persisted. The file could be deleted and a new one created, but it was decided to report this as an unfixed bug so that it could be discussed. 
  ![bug WAVE](documentation/bugs/unfixed-indentatoin.png)
